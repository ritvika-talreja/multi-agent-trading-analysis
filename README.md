# Multi-Agent Financial Trading System using Crew AI

## 📝 Project Overview
This project is a **Local Trading Research Assistant** built using **Crew AI**, a framework for creating autonomous multi-agent systems. The system leverages multiple AI agents, each specialized in a specific domain of financial trading:
- 🧑‍💼 **Data Analyst Agent:** Monitors and analyzes market data in real-time.  
- 📊 **Trading Strategy Developer:** Designs trading strategies based on market insights.  
- 💡 **Trade Advisor:** Provides execution recommendations for trading strategies.  
- ⚖️ **Risk Advisor:** Evaluates and advises on trading risks.  

The agents collaborate to fetch market data, analyze trends, formulate strategies, recommend execution, and assess risks, providing a **comprehensive financial trading insight**.

## 🤔 How Crew AI Works
1. **Task Assignment:** Each agent is assigned tasks based on their role.  
2. **Tool Utilization:** Agents can use tools like web scrapers or search APIs to gather data.  
3. **Delegation & Collaboration:** Agents can delegate subtasks to other agents if required.  
4. **Task Completion:** Agents generate outputs for their tasks.  
5. **Aggregation:** Crew AI combines results from all agents into a final output.
